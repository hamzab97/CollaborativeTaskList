# CollaborativeTaskList
Users are able to collaborate on one task unified task list and keep track of everything that needs to be accomplished or has been finished.Idea was inspired by working in many group projects during school where it proved hard to coordinate tasks, this app will help everyone add tasks to one list that all other members can see and they can also see who added the task and who completed it.

Project uses FireBase Real Time Database as backend to store information users input then updates the list view to show new information.
